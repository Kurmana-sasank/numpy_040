# numpy_040

Numpy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

Besides its obvious scientific uses, Numpy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.
